Here is the code and metadata for the analysis of the fungal communities among the rhizospheres. 

It is divided into:
1) analysis of only the rhizospheres
2) analysis of the rhizospheres and bulk topsoil of the 2-year-old plantation of A. mangium
3) analysis of the rhizospheres and bulk topsoil of the 10-year-old plantation of A. mangium
4) analysis of all rhizospheres and bulk topsoil samples together
5) analysis of samples of the bulk topsoil

Raw sequence reads on the topsoil were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under the BioProject ID and accession number PRJNA1295595, while raw reads of the rhizosphere can be accessed through PRJNA1302026
