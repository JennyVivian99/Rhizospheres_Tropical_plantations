Here is the code for the analysis of the fungal communities among the rhizospheres.
It is divided into:
1) analysis of only the rhizospheres
2) analysis of the rhizospheres and bulk topsoil of the 2-year-old plantation of A. mangium
3) analysis of the rhizospheres and bulk topsoil of the 10-year-old plantation of A. mangium
4) analysis of all rhizospheres and bulk topsoil samples together
5) analysis of samples of the bulk topsoil
