## Analysis of the rhizospheres of dominant plant species in tropical plantations
Repository for the code to analyze the fungal and bacterial communities of the rhizosphere of _Acacia mangium, Coccos nucifera, Swietenia macrophylla, Pterocarpus indicus, Saccharum spp._ and _Imperata cylindrica_.

Information on the location of raw sequences is reported in the Fungi and Bacteria folders, along with the codes used.

In the metadata file, longitude and latitude are reported as similar values among the samples due to being sensitive data. They represent a general location, that of the Philippines, as found in search engines.
While "Rhizosphere" metadata is focused on the samples' description of the rhizospheres, Fungi and Bacteria files report bulk topsoil characteristics as well.

The information and codes of this repository were used for the publication "_Insert name_"
